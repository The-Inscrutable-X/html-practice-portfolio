<h1>Hanqi Xiao's favorite movies list</h1>
<h2>My top X movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind</h3>
<p>Best movie ever! Introduced me to ghibli. Potentially biased opinion 
    due to naustalgia. Great animation as always. Believable tone. Postapocaliptic.
    Environmentalist. Giant worms, bugs, and plants.
</p>

<h3>I Robot</h3>
<p>Watched due to reading Issac Asimov. Emotionally coherent
    Logically less coherent.
</p>

<h3>Black Adam</h3>
<p>Fun superhero action, extremely hard hitting music. The epic music
    alone gives it re-watch value.</p>

<h3>DUNE (modern)</h3>
<p>Beautifully shot. Incredible universe. Leaves on a bit of 
    a cliffhanger. Both good and bad.
